## DeReal


## Share spontaneous moments, triggered by smart contracts! DeReal brings transparency into the life of everyone through their cameras. (P.S You get rewards too!)

DeReal is a decentralized social media platform that aims to bring transparency into users, and people while also incentivizing their good motives. It utilizes the curiosity of general humankind, while also giving them a peep into their favorite influencers' actual day! 
The way the app works is, once signed up you get notified of events. At any **random moment** in the day, an event would pop up prompting the user for a photo. After which they have approximately two minutes to click a picture and post it, aka, DeReal.
## Problem: 
The app aims to solve the problem of transparency, and acceptance through it. On general social media, people see highlights of other influencers and don't realize how small of a part of their life it represents. They need to understand that it's normal to be without makeup, or spend time getting ready - just Being Real is what is needed!
## Solution: 
A decentralized app, that brings the thrill of randomness into people's lives, while appraising their good wishes through incentives offered through brand promotions, and sponsors. It also enables gamification through streaks and NFTs.
## Future scope:

- Add streaks - already have made the digital designs, will start a streak manager and counter for the users.
- Add profile viewing options.
- Introduce product promotions.
